## Finite-element-analysis-on-perforated-plates
(Course: Basic Principle for Steel Structure, Teachers: Prof. Yiyi Chen & Prof. Cheng Fang, Semester 20-21(1))
- Analyzed (with ANSYS) the stress distribution of the perforated plate under axial compression 
- Explored the influence of boundary conditions and different locations, shapes, relative sizes of holes on the stress distribution of perforated plates.
